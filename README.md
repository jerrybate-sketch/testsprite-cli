### The verification layer for the agentic coding era.

AI ships code in minutes — verifying it hasn't. `testsprite` opens your live app, uses it like a real user, and shows your coding agent exactly what broke — so it fixes its own work before a bug ever reaches you.

<sub><b>Proof, in public: verification beats model size.</b> With this CLI in the loop, the cheapest model in the field shipped the most correct app on an open leaderboard — <b>89%</b>, at half the cost of the priciest one. <a href="https://codercup.ai">See the leaderboard →</a></sub>

## What is it?

[TestSprite](https://www.testsprite.com) is the AI testing platform 100,000+ teams use to test their software, frontend and backend — in the cloud, against the live product, not mocks. This repo is its official CLI.

It puts that platform in your coding agent's hands: the agent verifies every behavior it ships, and what broke comes back as **one self-consistent bundle** it can act on — no dashboard scraping. Humans drive the same surface from a terminal or CI.

## ⭐️ Star the Repository

<img width="900" height="506" alt="testsprite-repo-star-fast" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c3975df-8d47-4d6c-a485-135b80f779a5" />

If you find `testsprite` useful, a GitHub Star ⭐️ would be greatly appreciated — it helps other builders (and their agents) find the project, and stars notify you about new releases.

## Quickstart

Requires **Node.js 20.19+**, **22.13+**, or **24+**. (No global install? `npx @testsprite/testsprite-cli` works too.)

```bash
npm install -g @testsprite/testsprite-cli
testsprite setup
```

`testsprite setup` prompts for your [API key](https://www.testsprite.com), verifies it, and installs the verification-loop skill for the coding agents this project uses — one command, so your agent is wired to verify its own work.

**Which agent it installs for.** Each of the eight supported targets — `claude`, `cursor`, `cline`, `windsurf`, `antigravity`, `kiro`, `copilot`, `codex` — lands its skill in a different place, so `setup` works out which you use: the agent calling it, if it identifies itself, together with every agent whose config is already in the project. It installs for all of them and prints what it found — in a terminal it shows you that list first, so you can accept it or narrow it before anything is written. If nothing identifies an agent, it installs for `claude` and says so — that is the one case where you want `--agent <target>` to name one yourself. Check the result any time with `testsprite agent status`.

Non-interactive (CI / onboarding scripts):

```bash
TESTSPRITE_API_KEY=sk-... testsprite setup --from-env --yes
```

> **Pointing a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, …) at TestSprite?** Have it run `testsprite setup` first — that installs the verification skill, so the agent knows how to create, run, and triage tests on its own (instead of guessing from this README). `setup` reports which agents it installed for; add `--agent <target>` if that list is not the one you wanted. New here? Start with the **[getting-started overview](https://docs.testsprite.com/cli/getting-started/overview)**.

> **Privacy note:** interactive runs check the npm registry at most once per 24 h to offer a "new version available" notice — package name only, never your key or data; `TESTSPRITE_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1` disables it. The backend also advertises its minimum supported CLI version — a below-floor CLI prints a one-line upgrade advisory on stderr, and a too-old client may be rejected with exit 14 (`CLIENT_TOO_OLD`). Details in [DOCUMENTATION.md → Update notice](./DOCUMENTATION.md#update-notice).

From there, the loop runs on its own — an example session, typed by the coding agent:

```bash
# 1 — describe the behavior you want to guarantee, run it, wait
testsprite test create --project proj_8f0f6 --type frontend \
  --plan-from ./checkout-flow.plan.json --run --wait --output json
#   → exits 1: the run failed

# 2 — pull ONE self-consistent failure bundle
testsprite test failure get test_3a9f21c7 --out ./.testsprite/failure

# 3 — the agent reads the bundle, fixes the code, then replays
testsprite test rerun test_3a9f21c7 --wait --output json
#   → exits 0: passed. The test now lives in your durable suite.
```

`./checkout-flow.plan.json` (the `--plan-from` argument above) is a JSON file describing the test in plain language — no browser code required. This is the exact, byte-identical output of `testsprite test create --plan-template` (also embedded verbatim in `test create --help`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestSprite/testsprite-cli/v0.4.0/schemas/plan.schema.json",
  "projectId": "prj_abc123",
  "type": "frontend",
  "name": "Login rejects an empty password",
  "planSteps": [
    {
      "type": "action",
      "description": "Navigate to /login and submit the form with an empty password"
    },
    {
      "type": "assertion",
      "description": "Verify an inline error says the password is required"
    }
  ]
}
```

Get this exact skeleton without hand-copying it (and without the risk of it drifting from your installed version — see below): `testsprite test create --plan-template`. Full field reference (including the `{{...}}`-placeholder caveat, size caps, and the `$schema` hook for live editor validation): [Plan file format](./DOCUMENTATION.md#plan-file-format).

> The `$schema` URL above is pinned to the CLI version that generated this doc (`v0.4.0`) — `--plan-template`'s live output always pins to **your installed version** instead, which is what actually resolves. If you're reading this on a later release, run the command yourself rather than trusting this snippet verbatim.

**Don't want to write the first tests yourself?** For a deployed target, ask TestSprite to propose them. Local projects use the authored-plan flow below. `testsprite test plan generate --project <id>` explores your app (or reads the API spec you uploaded with `project docs upload`), drafts test cases, and stages them for review — nothing is written to your disk. You read the printed table and keep what you want:

```bash
testsprite test plan generate --project proj_8f0f6           # stages proposals for review
testsprite test plan accept --project proj_8f0f6             # → real tests
testsprite test plan accept --project proj_8f0f6 --only prop_2 prop_5   # or just these
```

It only runs what the project is still missing, so a second call picks up where the first left off. Generation spends workspace credits per stage that actually runs (the result line reports the spend), and a PRD uploaded with `project docs upload --role prd` bills 0.5 credits for its embedding — an API spec is free. Full walkthrough, including what happens on Ctrl-C and every precondition error: [Generate commands](./DOCUMENTATION.md#generate-commands).

Prefer to configure each step by hand (or learn the surface offline with `--dry-run` first)? See [Manual setup](./DOCUMENTATION.md#manual-setup) and [Install & verify](./DOCUMENTATION.md#install--verify).

## Testing an app on your machine (--local)

Frontend tests can reach your running app through a TestSprite tunnel, including on the Free plan (ordinary run credits apply).
Use an API key with `run:tunnel`: keys minted before that scope existed need to be replaced; the CLI names the missing scope.

```bash
testsprite project create --type frontend --name "My local app" --local 3000
testsprite test create --plan-from ./checkout.plan.json --project <project-id>
testsprite test run <test-id> --local 3000  # per-run tunnel; waits up to 1200 seconds
# Or keep one tunnel open in terminal A (no port argument)
testsprite tunnel start --ttl 3600
# Terminal B: borrow the clientId printed above; keep terminal A running
testsprite test run <test-id> --local 3000 --tunnel-client <client-uuid>
```

Run one test per invocation; parallel invocations are fine (5 live tunnel bindings per user); `--all --local` is refused.
A second `tunnel start` or process using the same credential takes over, and the first exits **10**.
The examples use `127.0.0.1`. For another loopback listener, pass the same `--local-host localhost` or `--local-host ::1` to project creation and every follow-up run. The selected host is stored in the project URL (`::1` becomes `http://[::1]:<port>`); `project get/list` exposes `originMode: 'local'` in JSON and shows `(Local)` in text output.
The control plane is WebSocket over TLS (`wss://control.tun.testsprite.com/ws`). The data plane, which carries the tunnel secret and proxied traffic, uses TLS at `data.tun.testsprite.com:443` and verifies the certificate with Node's default trust store: its bundled Mozilla roots, plus certificates supplied through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` and the system CAs when Node is started with `--use-system-ca`. Node 20 is supported without losing `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Verification cannot be disabled, and the CLI never falls back from TLS to plaintext. On a network that re-signs TLS, export your organisation's root CA to a PEM file and set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/ca.pem` before running `testsprite`. Plaintext connects and TLS handshakes each time out after 10 seconds. The first failed attempt starts a **60-second** retry episode; writing `TunnelHello` is not enough to reset it. The episode ends only after the first inbound tunnel stream or after the socket remains open for 5 seconds following the hello. A real deadline timer stays armed across retries and destroys an in-flight socket when it expires. After that, an owned `test run --local` run is cancelled and refunded and the command exits **10**; `tunnel start` exits **10**. If a self-hosted or older TestSprite server does not advertise a TLS endpoint, the CLI prints a one-time warning and uses legacy plaintext port **7400** under the same timeout and retry rules. `tunnel start` prints `transport: tls` or `transport: plaintext`.
An owned tunnel's timeout or Ctrl-C cancels the run by default. A borrowed run still detaches without cancellation on Ctrl-C/SIGTERM because its owner keeps the tunnel alive; if that owner disappears while the run is active, the borrower cancels its own run and reports `cancelled`, `already finished`, or `skipped`. A run cancelled before it finishes is refunded. `--no-cancel-on-interrupt` also skips this owner-gone cancellation. Keep the early `Run <runId>` receipt on stderr and read the reported run before re-running.
Local projects skip exploration/plan generation; author plans with `test create --plan-from`. Portal runs are blocked for free until you set a public project URL.
See [the full local-testing reference](./DOCUMENTATION.md#local-frontend-testing-and-tunnels) for flags, login, billing/refunds, timeouts, and retargeting.

> The earlier command names — `init`, `auth configure`, `auth whoami`, `auth logout` — still work as hidden, deprecated aliases (each prints a one-line notice pointing at the new name), so existing scripts keep running. `auth configure` now runs the full `setup` (it also installs the skill).

📚 **Full reference — every command, flag, and example:** [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md), including [configuration & profiles](./DOCUMENTATION.md#configuration), [scripting](./DOCUMENTATION.md#output--scripting), and [exit codes](./DOCUMENTATION.md#exit-codes).

## Why a CLI for coding agents?

- 🧪 **Tests like a real user.** Runs against a live browser or API in the cloud — real clicks, real navigation, real assertions. Not a mock.
- 🤖 **Agent-shaped output.** `test failure get` returns **one bundle** — the failing step, its neighbors, screenshots, DOM snapshots, the test source, a root-cause hypothesis, and a recommended fix target — all sharing a single `snapshotId`. The CLI _refuses_ to stitch data from two different runs, so an agent never reasons over a frankenstein context.
- ♻️ **A loop, not a one-shot.** `create → run → failure get → fix → rerun` — every pass is banked, not thrown away.
- 📐 **Scriptable & deterministic.** Stable `--output json` contract, predictable [exit codes](./DOCUMENTATION.md#exit-codes), and a `--dry-run` that exercises the full code path offline with canned data.
- 🚦 **CI-native.** On GitHub Actions, `--wait` runs annotate the PR checks tab with one `::error::` per failure and append a results table to the job summary — automatically. Add `--report junit` for a JUnit XML sidecar, `--summary-file` for a machine summary, or `--gh-output` to preview the annotations locally. Runs in any CI, not just GitHub. [Details →](./DOCUMENTATION.md#continuous-integration)
- 🔌 **One command to onboard your agent.** `testsprite setup` drops ready-made skill files into your repo — for the agents it detects you using — so your coding agent knows how to drive the loop on its own.

## How it works

Every time your agent changes code, it asks one question: **is this behavior already covered by the suite?**

- **Not yet covered** → `testsprite test create` — describe the new behavior, run it.
- **Already covered** → `testsprite test rerun` — replay the existing tests, so nothing that used to work breaks silently.
- **Something fails** → `testsprite test failure get` — one self-consistent bundle; the agent fixes the code and reruns.

Every pass is banked into a durable suite, so coverage compounds as the project grows — a lasting record of every requirement it has ever gotten right, far bigger than any context window.

```

The cloud is a black box on purpose: your agent describes intent and reads results. It never has to know _how_ the test was driven — only _what_ a real user experienced.

## Proved in public

On [**CoderCup**](https://codercup.ai) — an open leaderboard where frontier coding agents build the _same_ app under the _same_ rules, with TestSprite as the referee — the **cheapest** model in the field shipped the **most correct** app on the board: **89%**, at half the cost of the priciest one.

That's the point of all of this: you no longer need the biggest, most expensive model to ship software you can trust — top-tier quality, without paying top-tier prices, within reach of every team.
