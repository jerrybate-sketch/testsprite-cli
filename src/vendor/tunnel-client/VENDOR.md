# Vendored: TestSprite tunnel Node client

`client.ts`, `protocol.ts` and `types.ts` are copies of the tunnel repo's
`clients/node/src/`. They are **not** to be edited except through the deltas
listed below — fix protocol bugs upstream and re-sync.

## Why vendored rather than reimplemented

There are already three implementations of this wire protocol — the Rust
server, this Node client, and the MCP plugin's hand-port. The hand-port drifted
and shipped without the frame-bounds fix (`MAX_TUNNEL_FRAME` in `protocol.ts`),
which is what let four stray bytes (`"GET "`, read as a length prefix) decode to
a 1.1 GiB allocation and take dev down on 2026-08-14. A fourth independent
implementation is not acceptable, so this is a copy with a diffable delta list
and a sync script — not a fork.

## Deliberate deltas from upstream

Everything here is an isolated, one-purpose change. Anything larger belongs
upstream.

1. **`ws` → `./ws-compat.ts`** (`client.ts`, one import line). This CLI ships
   three runtime dependencies on purpose; `undici` is already one of them and
   its `WebSocket` is the same RFC 6455 implementation. See that file for the
   two behavioural notes (`ping`/`pong` and the global dispatcher).
2. **`lodash` → `./lodash-lite.ts`** (`client.ts`, one import line). Three
   predicates, a dozen lines.
3. **`./config.ts` rewritten.** Upstream reads `TSTUN_*` env vars and falls
   back to hard-coded TestSprite dev ALB/NLB hostnames. Those must not ship in
   a package published to the public npm registry, and a default endpoint is
   precisely the failure the facade exists to prevent — `controlUrl` and
   `tunnelAddr` come from `POST /api/cli/v1/tunnel` and nowhere else. The
   endpoint defaults are removed and the two options are now **required**
   (`types.ts` delta). `CLIENT_VERSION` (an upstream `package.json` import)
   is dropped; it was only referenced from commented-out code.
4. **`logSink`** (`types.ts` + `client.ts`). Upstream logs through
   `console.log` / `console.warn`, i.e. STDOUT, which would corrupt this CLI's
   `--output json` contract. Default sink is stderr; the CLI injects its own.
5. **`./index.ts`** additionally re-exports `resolveDialCandidates` and
   `blockedTargetReason`, so the pre-charge port preflight dials the same
   candidate set the client dials at run time instead of an independent guess.
6. **Not copied:** `control.ts` (dead — `client.ts` handles the control plane
   inline and never imports it), `cli.ts`, `utils.ts`, `tunnel.ts` (empty),
   `example/`.
7. **IPv6 target classification uses binary `net.BlockList` matching**
   (`client.ts`). The spelling-specific `toIpv4Mapped()` regexes are removed;
   mapped loopback stays allowed, while compatible, mapped, translated, and
   NAT64 embedded-IPv4 spaces are refused consistently across textual forms.

8. **`stop()` also closes a control socket still in `CONNECTING`**
   (`client.ts`). Upstream closes only an `OPEN` one, so a control plane that
   accepts TCP without completing the WebSocket handshake left `stop()` awaiting
   the control loop parked in that handshake — it never returned, and the
   caller's teardown never reached the credential delete that follows it.
   `ws-compat.ts` gained the matching `CONNECTING` static.
9. **Reconnect backoffs are cancellable** (`client.ts`). Both the control and
   tunnel loops wait on the same lifecycle abort signal; `stop()` aborts it
   before awaiting either loop, so teardown settles promptly and leaves no
   referenced backoff timer behind. A later `start()` creates a fresh signal.
10. **6to4, Teredo, and deprecated IPv6 site-local space are refused**
    (`client.ts`). `2002::/16` and `2001::/32` are IPv4-derived encapsulation
    prefixes and join delta 7's embedded-IPv4 refusal; `fec0::/10` joins the
    private-scope ranges. `2001:db8::/32` remains allowed.
11. **NAT64 and IPv4-compatible refusal widened to `/32`** (`client.ts`).
    Delta 7's NAT64 and IPv4-compatible entries were the canonical-form
    prefixes only (`64:ff9b::/96` + `64:ff9b:1::/48`; `::/96`) — a
    reserved-but-non-canonical NAT64 prefix landing between the two (e.g.
    `64:ff9b:ffff::a9fe:a9fe`, which is in neither) still reached the network
    unrejected. Both are now the single `/32` superset of their family
    (`64:ff9b::/32`; `::/32`), matching `src/lib/target-url.ts`'s
    `NAT64_SUBNETS` / `IPV4_COMPATIBLE_SUBNETS` — the two host classifiers'
    embedded-IPv4 coverage is meant to be identical (see that file's doc
    comment), and this delta is what makes that claim true again. Both
    widened prefixes sit inside IETF-reserved space (`0064::/16`,
    `0000::/8`), so nothing globally routable is newly refused. `::1` and
    mapped loopback (`::ffff:127.0.0.0/104`) are unaffected: the loopback
    `BlockList` in `blockedTargetReason` is checked first and returns before
    this one is consulted. Note the coverage here is NOT identical to
    `target-url.ts`'s in both directions — this file additionally refuses 6to4,
    Teredo and site-local (delta 10), which that one does not; the two agree on
    the embedded-IPv4 family and deliberately disagree on loopback.

12. **`ws-compat.ts`'s `close()` is not a passthrough** (no vendored file
    changed). Upstream's `ws` resolves `stop()` because the peer answers the
    closing handshake. undici's `WebSocket.close()` on an OPEN connection only
    SENDS a Close frame and sets `CLOSING` — it never aborts the controller,
    destroys the socket, or applies any timeout — so a control peer that never
    answers left the socket ref'd and the process hung with the right message
    already printed. The shim therefore arms a bounded grace timer, `unref()`s
    the raw socket it captured from undici's `undici:client:connected`
    diagnostics channel, and SYNTHESIZES a `close` event (code 1006) so
    `client.ts`'s own unmodified `ws.on("close", ...)` handler runs exactly as
    it would for a real close. Recorded here because the delta is invisible in
    `client.ts`'s diff: a future re-sync must not assume `close()` is a thin
    forward, and the capture filter in particular is load-bearing — a miss
    there is silent and restores the hang with every test still green.
13. **Outstanding proxy target sockets are destroyed on teardown** (`client.ts`).
    Upstream tracks only `runtime.socket` (the tunnel data-plane socket) and
    leaves each per-stream target socket dialed in `connectOnce` to close on its
    own. But the browser proxies ALL of its traffic through the tunnel, so a run
    routinely opens keep-alive connections to external hosts (e.g.
    `accounts.google.com:443`) that hold the socket open and send nothing —
    `proxyStreams`'s `copyOneWay(target, …)` then parks forever and its
    `finally`-cleanup never runs. Destroying `runtime.socket` does not reach these
    independent sockets, so on `stop()` they stay `ESTABLISHED` and ref'd, keeping
    the event loop alive until the remote's own idle timeout (minutes). Visible
    symptom: a `--local` run's Ctrl-C or `--timeout` printed the right message,
    cancelled the run server-side, then hung. Fix: a `activeTargetSockets` set,
    populated in `connectOnce` (removed on `close`) and drained in
    `stopAllTunnelRuntimes` — the single data-plane teardown chokepoint, so both
    `stop()` and a `CloseTunnel` clean up. Complements #12: that closed the
    control socket, this closes the data-plane target sockets — a distinct leak
    the control-socket fix exposed rather than covered. Upstream candidate
    (DEV-1030): the Rust client has the same shape.
14. **`start()` waits for the current control socket's authentication Ack**
    (`client.ts`, `types.ts`, `config.ts`). Upstream resolves `start()` from
    `control-connected`, emitted in the WebSocket `open` handler before the
    `Auth` frame is sent, so callers can trigger a run while the server still
    reports the client offline. This copy keeps that transport event in place
    and adds `control-authenticated`, emitted only for the first `Ack` on each
    socket. A monotonically increasing connection generation scopes the wait;
    reconnects re-arm the first-Ack state and an older socket cannot satisfy a
    newer `start()`. A pre-Ack socket close/error rejects immediately, while
    `authTimeoutMs` (10 seconds by default, matching the existing heartbeat and
    target-connect windows) bounds a server that accepts the socket but never
    acknowledges authentication. None of those rejection paths bypasses the
    existing `stop()` handling for `CONNECTING` or `OPEN` sockets.
15. **Blocked-target advice names only supported remedies** (`client.ts`).
    Upstream's `BlockedTargetError` tells callers to set
    `TS_TUNNEL_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_TARGET` or enable the corresponding client
    option. This CLI reads no such environment variable and hard-codes the
    option `false`, so that advice named a switch its users cannot flip. The
    message now states the actual reachability policy (this machine's loopback
    plus the public internet) and tells the user to make the dependency
    reachable through one of those routes. The guard itself is unchanged.

16. **Terminal revocation and connection takeover** (`client.ts`). The server
    permits one live control connection per credential: a newer connection using
    the same credential or an in-place secret rotation closes the older connection
    with `1008 AUTH_FAILED`, the close every shipped client treats as terminal.
    Deletion sends `1008 CLIENT_REVOKED`; there is no `1012` reconnect signal.
    Both closes report `ErrCode.AuthFailed`, stop the control loop, tear down
    tunnel runtimes, and abort pending data-plane reconnect delays without
    reconnecting. `CLIENT_REVOKED` reports `tunnel credential revoked`.
    `AUTH_FAILED` after that connection's Ack reports
    `tunnel connection superseded or credential revoked`; before its Ack, the
    existing authentication-failure message is unchanged. The CLI maps both
    revocation messages to `credential-revoked` and exits 10 immediately; the
    15-second credential poll remains a backstop.
17. **TLS data-plane transport is being re-synced upstream in parallel**
    (`client.ts`, `types.ts`, `config.ts`). `tunnelTlsAddr` selects an immutable
    TLS transport; the public status is a getter backed by the ECMAScript private
    `#transportMode` field used for every dial, so JavaScript assignment cannot
    downgrade a live client.
    Both data-plane addresses are validated as strict `host:port` authorities at
    construction, including real IPv6 validation for `[v6]:port`. The client
    verifies SNI with Node's default trust store (bundled Mozilla roots,
    `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, and `--use-system-ca` when enabled) plus explicit extra
    CAs. On Node versions without `tls.getCACertificates('default')`, it combines
    `tls.rootCertificates` with PEM blocks read once from `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`
    before appending explicit roots. It requires TLS 1.2 or newer, bounds every
    TLS handshake and plaintext connect at 10 seconds, and writes `TunnelHello`
    only after `secureConnect`. DNS names are canonicalised to lower-case ASCII
    A-labels for both the dial and default SNI. Every retry stays on the selected
    transport and never falls back to `tunnelAddr`. The matching upstream
    implementation lives on `TestSprite/tunnel` branch `zeshi/tunnel-tls-data-plane`
    (`clients/node`, commits `a5fb58f`, `4b0f946`, `ad4dce3`; same option names
    and semantics, written in parallel rather than byte-synced). Once that branch
    is merged to `v2-patch`, do a real re-sync against it and update the source
    commit/blob table rather than dropping this delta.
18. **Data-plane retries have a terminal deadline** (`client.ts`, `types.ts`,
    `config.ts`). `dataPlaneRetryDeadlineMs` defaults to 60 seconds; `0` preserves
    indefinite retry. Each tunnel runtime starts one failure episode at the first
    failed dial, timeout, or pre-establishment close. A successful `TunnelHello`
    write does not reset it. Establishment is the first inbound yamux stream or a
    socket surviving for `dataPlaneSettleMs` (5 seconds by default) after that
    write; only establishment ends the episode. A real monotonic deadline timer
    remains armed across attempts and destroys a connecting, handshaking, or
    awaiting-establishment socket when it fires. Exhaustion emits exactly one
    `ErrCode.DataPlaneUnreachable` with the selected transport, configured
    address, and redacted last error, then initiates the same socket/timer/runtime
    teardown as `stop()`. Intentional shutdown clears the deadline and suppresses
    interrupted-dial errors. The `dataPlaneRetryDeadlineMs`, `dataPlaneSettleMs`,
    and `connectTimeoutMs` names and lifecycle semantics intentionally match the
    upstream SDK change being developed in parallel.

## Re-syncing

Maintainers diff the three vendored files against a checkout of the upstream
tunnel client at the commit named above, apply upstream changes by hand,
re-apply the deltas listed here, then update the table at the top of this file.
The blob hashes above are what that check compares against.

## Target policy

`ensureTargetAllowed` is upstream's, unchanged: **loopback and
globally-routable targets are allowed; private/reserved space is refused.**
Do not narrow this to loopback-only — the execution Lambda's Chromium proxies
_every_ request through this client (`bypass='<-loopback>'`), so a page pulling
a web font or hitting an identity provider is normal traffic. Verified on dev
2026-08-24: `accounts.google.com` and `cf.browser-use.com` both crossed the same
client during a real `--local` run. `allowPrivateNetworkTarget` is hard-coded
`false` here and is not exposed as a CLI flag.
