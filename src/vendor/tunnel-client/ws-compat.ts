/**
 * VENDOR DELTA (not upstream). A minimal `ws`-shaped facade over undici's
 * WHATWG `WebSocket`, so the vendored tunnel client keeps its upstream body
 * while this CLI adds no `ws` dependency: `undici` is already a runtime
 * dependency here (`lib/proxy.ts` uses its `EnvHttpProxyAgent`), and its
 * `WebSocket` is the same RFC 6455 implementation Node ships as the global.
 *
 * Only the surface `client.ts` actually touches is implemented — `on`,
 * `send`, `close`, `pong`, `readyState`, and the statics `CONNECTING`/`OPEN`. Anything else
 * is deliberately absent, and an unknown event name throws rather than being
 * silently accepted, so a future upstream sync that reaches for a new `ws` API
 * fails loudly instead of quietly never firing.
 *
 * Two behavioural notes, both a consequence of WHATWG's narrower surface:
 *
 *   - **`ping` never fires and `pong()` is a no-op.** The WHATWG API does not
 *     expose control frames; undici answers a server PING with a PONG inside
 *     its own receiver, which is exactly what upstream's handler did by hand.
 *     Registering the listener is still accepted so the upstream line stays
 *     compilable and diffable.
 *   - **The control socket uses the process-global undici dispatcher**, so an
 *     `HTTP(S)_PROXY` this CLI honours (`lib/proxy.ts`) also carries the
 *     control WebSocket. Deliberate — but note it does NOT help the tunnel
 *     DATA plane, which uses a direct TLS socket for advertised TLS endpoints
 *     and raw TCP only for the explicit legacy transport. Both bypass HTTP
 *     proxies. `lib/tunnel-session.ts` warns about that asymmetry rather than
 *     pretending a proxied environment is supported.
 *
 * ## Why `close()` cannot just call `WebSocket.close()` and wait
 *
 * Read straight from undici's own source (`lib/web/websocket/connection.js`):
 * `WebSocket.close()` on an OPEN connection sends a Close frame and sets the
 * ready state to CLOSING — nothing more. It does not abort the underlying
 * connection and does not time out; that only happens for a CONNECTING
 * socket (`failWebsocketConnection`, upstream `client.ts` VENDOR DELTA #8's
 * territory). If the peer never sends its own Close frame back — a redeploy
 * mid-handshake, a proxy that swallows the FIN, a server too busy to answer —
 * the ready state sits at CLOSING forever, the JS `'close'` event never
 * fires, and the socket stays an active libuv handle. Confirmed empirically:
 * against a stub that completes the WS upgrade and then never answers a
 * Close frame, `TunnelClient.stop()` (which awaits exactly this event) never
 * resolves, and `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()` shows the same
 * `TCPSocketWrap` present indefinitely. There is no public undici API to
 * force it — `#handler.socket` is a true private class field, and even a
 * dedicated per-connection `Dispatcher.destroy()` does nothing once the
 * connection has been upgraded (verified: undici hands the socket off to the
 * `WebSocket` instance at that point, detaching it from the dispatcher's own
 * bookkeeping).
 *
 * So `close()` here arms a short local grace timer alongside the real
 * WHATWG close. If the peer answers within it, the real `'close'` event
 * settles everything and the timer is a no-op. If it doesn't, we settle
 * locally instead of waiting forever:
 *
 *   - `.unref()` (never `.destroy()`) the raw socket, captured at connect
 *     time via undici's documented `undici:client:connected` diagnostics
 *     channel — a public, if "Experimental"-labeled, hook that hands us the
 *     `net.Socket` undici itself dialed, filtered to this connection's own
 *     host/port so an unrelated concurrent undici connection is never
 *     mistaken for it. `unref()` is the right tool and `.destroy()` is not:
 *     by the time the grace period expires we have already sent our own
 *     Close frame and have no further use for the socket — there is no
 *     work left that it is the last thing holding open, which is exactly
 *     the bar this codebase's timer-`unref` doctrine sets (contrast the
 *     rejected fix elsewhere in this repo, where `unref`ing a POLLING
 *     timer let a process exit before its work was done — this is the
 *     opposite situation, a corpse the peer refuses to bury after the work
 *     is already finished). `.destroy()` would instead reset the still-open
 *     TCP connection out from under a peer that might complete its side a
 *     moment later, for no benefit we need.
 *   - Synthesize the `'close'` event ourselves (code 1006, "abnormal
 *     closure" — the conventional code for "the connection just went away",
 *     and never confused with an auth failure: `client.ts`'s
 *     `isAuthFailureClose` only matches code 1008) so `client.ts`'s own
 *     unmodified `ws.on("close", ...)` handler runs exactly as it would for
 *     a real close: it clears the heartbeat interval, resolves the
 *     `connectControl()` promise `runControlLoop` is stuck awaiting, and
 *     unwinds `stop()`'s own `Promise.allSettled`. No vendored file needs to
 *     change for this — the synthetic close travels through the exact same,
 *     already-correct listener.
 *
 * A proxied connection is NOT a miss, which is worth stating because it looks
 * like one: with `EnvHttpProxyAgent` installed as the global dispatcher,
 * undici publishes TWO `undici:client:connected` events — the physical dial to
 * the proxy, whose `connectParams` carry the PROXY's host/port, and a second
 * one from the per-origin `Client` it creates internally, whose `connectParams`
 * carry the TARGET's. The filter below matches the second and captures the
 * same live socket (physically connected to the proxy, tunneled to the
 * target). Verified against undici 7.29.0 with a real CONNECT proxy: a `--local`
 * teardown under `HTTP_PROXY` exits in the same ~1.4s as without one. The `wss:`
 * variant TLS-wraps that tunneled socket and was not exercised — it is
 * analogous by code reading only.
 *
 * If capture DOES miss — the channel never fires, or a future undici publishes
 * a different payload shape — the synthetic close still clears the heartbeat,
 * but the control socket stays ref'd and **the original hang comes back**. That
 * is the honest statement: this is not a socket "left for process exit to
 * reap", because nothing forces this process to exit — a ref'd socket IS the
 * bug. Treat any change to the filter as load-bearing. Never throws either way:
 * a diagnostics hook failing must not break teardown.
