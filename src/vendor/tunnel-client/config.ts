/**
 * VENDOR DELTA (not upstream). Upstream's `config.ts` reads `TSTUN_*`
 * environment variables and falls back to **hard-coded TestSprite dev
 * ALB/NLB hostnames**. Neither belongs in a package published to the public
 * npm registry:
 *
 *   - the endpoints are internal infrastructure names, and a default value is
 *     still a value that ships;
 *   - a default endpoint is the failure mode the facade exists to prevent.
 *     `POST /api/cli/v1/tunnel` returns `controlUrl`, `tunnelAddr`, and
 *     optionally `tunnelTlsAddr` for the environment the caller authenticated
 *     against, and those are the ONLY endpoints this client may dial. A default would let a
 *     misconfigured/partially-constructed client silently connect somewhere
 *     else and fail in a way that reads like an auth problem.
 *
 * So the endpoint defaults are gone and `TunnelClientOptions.controlUrl` /
 * `.tunnelAddr` are required by the caller (`lib/tunnel-session.ts` passes
 * the mint response through verbatim). The timing constants below are
 * upstream's values.
