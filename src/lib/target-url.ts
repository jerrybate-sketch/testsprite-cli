 * CLI-side pre-flight guard for `--target-url`.
 *
 * Defense-in-depth: the backend is the trust boundary and performs DNS
 * resolution. `assertNotLocal` below does **literal-only** checks
 * to give a fast, friendly error before sending the request — it cannot by
 * itself detect DNS rebinding (a public hostname that resolves to a private
 * IP). That gap is closed one layer up: `target-url-preflight.ts` reuses
 * `disallowedIpReason` (exported below) against the actually-*resolved*
 * address before probing, so the same range list guards both the literal
 * string and the DNS answer — not two drifting copies of it.
 *
 * CLI-side target-url guard (exit 5 on any rejection):
 *  - Reject non-http(s) schemes
 *  - Reject `localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `0.0.0.0/8`, and IPv6 loopback/unspecified (`::1`, `::`)
 *  - Reject `169.254.0.0/16` link-local and the `169.254.169.254` metadata address
 *  - Reject RFC1918 literal IPv4 (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x)
 *  - Reject carrier-grade NAT (`100.64.0.0/10`), multicast (`224.0.0.0/4`),
 *    and class E / limited broadcast (`240.0.0.0/4`)
 *  - Decode and re-classify the low 32 bits of standard embedded-IPv4 forms:
 *    IPv4-mapped/translated, RFC 6052 NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`), and deprecated
 *    IPv4-compatible (`::/96`); public embedded IPv4 addresses stay allowed
 *  - Reject RFC 8215's NAT64 local-use range (`64:ff9b:1::/48`) wholesale
 *  - Reject IPv6 link-local (`fe80::/10`), unique-local (`fc00::/7`), and
 *    deprecated site-local (`fec0::/10`)

 *  - `'loopback-other'` — the REST of `127.0.0.0/8` (e.g. `127.0.0.2`). This
 *    is loopback-range and unreachable from outside the machine, same as
 *    `'loopback'` above, but `--local-host` cannot dial it by name — an app

 *    reason can rebind their dev server onto `127.0.0.1` and get `--local`
 *    to work, but that's their call to make, not a claim this code asserts).
 *  - `'private'` — `--local` can never reach this class even in principle;
 *    hint that plainly, with no tunnel suggestion.
 *  - `'undecided'` — the address genuinely cannot be decoded safely (currently
 *    RFC 8215's `/48` NAT64 local-use range, whose embedded bit position differs
 *    from the `/96` well-known prefix), so neither hint is knowably true.
